# Municipal Open Data (MOD) - Boulder Open Data Portal Introduction 
Welcome to the Boulder Open Data Project! We are working with the City of Boulder to expand on their Open Data Portal (bouldercolorado.gov/open-data). This repository will be a Tutorial, intended for those unfamiliar or at the beginning stages of Data Analytics and Public Open Data.

Note: Many of the documents for this project reside on our Google Drive, and other locatons due to the nature of this project. Please check the Reference_Doc.
