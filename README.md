# Municipal Open Data (MOD) - Boulder Open Data Portal Introduction 
Welcome to the Boulder Open Data Project! We are working with the City of Boulder to expand on their Open Data Portal (bouldercolorado.gov/open-data). This repository will be a Tutorial, intended for those unfamiliar or at the beginning stages of Data Analytics and Public Open Data.

Note: Many of the documents for this project reside on our Google Drive, and other locatons due to the nature of this project. Please check the Reference.md.

### Setup

This entire repository is designed as a Python notebook. This is fully interactive, meant to be a test bed for the data and ideas that you want to work with. Install and run this notebook using these steps in a bash terminal:

~~~{.sh}
# Grab our repository
git clone MOD-Boulder_Open_Data_Portal_Introduction
cd MOD-Boulder_Open_Data_Portal_Introduction

# Create a virtual environment (keeps dependencies clean)
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install our dependencies
pip3 install -r venv_requirements.txt

# Run this notebook!
jupyter notebook
~~~

At this point, the notebook should open on your default browser. 

### Walkthrough

We will mainly work in Python in this notebook. If you work in another language (R), we welcome your participation/discussion/creations, but won't have our materials in languages other than Python for the time being.

1. What is Public Open Data?
2. What is Data Analytics?
3. I'm in, I want to help, how do I get started with Python?
    - I just want to start looking at numbers - Colaboratory (Google Python)
    - I really want to learn more about Python and install Anaconda/Python Notebooks on my computer (also see setup above)
4. What are good Python Libraries for data? What are the main Libraries to know?
5. Sample Python Notebooks with starter code
6. This was fun! Where do I learn more?
    - Python
    - Statistics
