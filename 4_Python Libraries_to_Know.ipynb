It's also helpful to see different types of explanations. Beyond these first few libraries, there are many, many more libraries out there. Go explore! \n",

    "\n",
    "Numpy gives you multidimensional array objects. Many other libraries are based off of Numpy, so you will also need Numpy to help run other packages. When you are just starting with Python and some basic analysis, you may use Numpy when doing means, medians and standard deviations. \n",

    "\n",
    "Pandas is indispensible for data wrangling! It will help you download/open a file in a data frame - a structure with rows and columns that looks very much like an excel spreadsheet. Dataframes make exploratory analysis easier by allowing you to look at counts of data features (including counts of null data); you can look at the first (or last) few rows of data to become more familiar with the data. You can also filter, sort and compare rows and columns fairly easily using Pandas.\n",

    "There are TONS of Python libraries out there. A quick Google search on 'what are the most important Python libraries to know' brings you many Top 5, Top 10, Top 20 lists. There are a lot of very cool packages, and it can get overwhelming quickly. I've always had the most luck with the project-focused approach. Dive into your problem and don't worry too much about **learning** libraries first. Basics are nice of course, but as problems/needs arise through your project, you'll figure out the solutions and learn about the libraries along the way. Good luck and HAVE FUN!"
