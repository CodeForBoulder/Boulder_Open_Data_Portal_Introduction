### What is Public Open Data?

    Public Open Data is any data the City (in this case) provides to the public in an accessible way. The Federal Open Data website, Data.gov states, "Opening government data increases citizen participation in government, creates opportunities for economic development, and informs decision making in both the private and public sectors."
